#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In order to interpret user needs and implement them into the program commuication is essential. Understanding the technical side of user needs and how they need to work would faciliate the process. This is where user stories are essential. User Stories help streamline user needs as it breaks down the feature and how it is intended to work along with complexity level. It essentially describes the user, what they wants, and why. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I feel like Agile will not only help me in software development but also real life. I am already a detailed and organized person and communication and transparency have always been something I strive for with companies I have worked with as it is an essential part of building relationships and compromising for what works for both parties to ensure the work gets done . However, daily stands-ups are something I hope to incorporate in the future. I feel like this is such a great tool as it allows for collaboration, different perspectives, and expereinces levels. As I would eventually like to learn and use development tools and become an "expert" as a tester. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development could mean a lot of things. However, personally I believe that a good team member is one who ask questions, completes the sotries, seeks help when needed  whether its in daily stand up or outside. One who commuicates and takes accountability. Someone who can help where needed if needed and doesn't hesitate to help in and jump others if the user stories they were woking on are completed and functional. Essentially someone who is willing to work towards the same goal everyone and the company is striving for.
